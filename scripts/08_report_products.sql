--BUILD PRODUCT REPORT
/*
=====================================================================================
Product Report
=====================================================================================
Purpose:
- This report consolidates key Product metrics and behaviours

Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
3. Aggregate Product-level purchased:
   - total orders
   - total sales
   - total quantity sold
   - total customers (unique)
   - lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
   - recency (months since last sale)
   - average order revenue (AOR)
   - average monthly revenue
